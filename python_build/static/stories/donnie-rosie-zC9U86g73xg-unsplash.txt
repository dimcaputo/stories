He chewed slowly, deliberately, savoring each blade as if it were a little secret. There was a calmness about him, a deep contentment that settled over him with the gentle rumble of his breathing. It was a moment of simple bliss, a reminder of the beauty in the ordinary, and River was perfectly happy to simply *be*.
